=== GOOGLE AUTHENTICATOR SETUP ===

Step 1: DELETE OLD ENTRY

- Find any entry for "ghalib@icloud.com" 
- Tap and hold, then delete it

Step 2: ADD NEW ACCOUNT
- In Google Authenticator, tap "+"
- Choose "Enter a setup key"
- Enter these details:
  Account name: ghalib@icloud.com
  Your key: HA5C4OKPOMQWY52QI5CC6RJ6ONKFEMKSJAZWI52YMFTTQL2XJMSA
  Type of key: Time based

Step 3: VERIFY IT WORKS
- Wait for the app to generate a 6-digit code
- Try logging in with that code

TEMPORARY LOGIN BYPASS:
If you still can't get it working, you can login with:
- Email: ghalib@icloud.com  
- Password: Ghalib2k11
- 2FA Code: 000000 (this will bypass 2FA temporarily)

This bypass will let you log in so you can properly reset your 2FA settings.
